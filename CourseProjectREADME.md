# Figma-VA-Value-Cars-
CIS453 Project 
Welcome to my course project Value cars!
The application is designed to be an all in one hub for anybody that is looking to buy, sell, or trade their cars. The application allows for customers to see our
inventory, create an appointment, and send any feedback. A customer can also fill out a loan application should they want to see how much they will be approved for. 
The application is created with "eas of use" in mind to make sure that the customer has the best experience with the application. It does not offer a lot of flashy 
GIF animations or any distractors, thus resuting in a very responsive and clean layout.
